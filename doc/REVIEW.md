Names
1. Variables: Some names do not clearly describe what variables they are describing. For example, the name plants is not clear since all the lists are about plants. All plants or my plants would be better names. 
2. Elements: Some names have the type they are behind like textfield and others do not. Be consistent in the way you name things. 
3. Spelling: check for spelling mistakes 

Comments
4. On time of viewing there are no comments at all, add comments to clarify the code. 

Layout
5. Make sure the order of functions within the whole app are the same. 
6. There is still some old code, delete code you do no use. 

Formatting
7. Some lines in the code have been spilt up so that the names align, with others it is all in the same line. Be consistent.

Headers
8. Headers are not present at the time of viewing, add headers to clarify the code. 

Flow
9. In some functions there several variabels made to be used very soon after. It might not be necaassary to create all these separate variabales if you donâ€™t reuse them. 
10. Why is the data parsed from the api in a view in which it is not shown. It might be better to load the data in the view it is used to minimalize the data used. 

Errors
11. Catch errors when data has failed to load. This is not done consistently.
